Marvel Movies Data Analytics

This project explores various aspects of the Marvel Movies dataset, including revenue trends, movie profitability, and the relationship between budget and earnings. It combines data analysis, visualization, and insights to uncover patterns and key takeaways about the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movies.

## Project Overview

In this analysis, I:
- **Analyzed the correlation** between movie budgets and worldwide earnings.
- Explored **revenue trends over time** to understand the growth of the MCU.
- Investigated the **rating distribution** across different platforms such as IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Letterboxd.
- Identified the **most profitable movies** based on absolute profit and profit margin.
- Created various visualizations, including scatter plots, line charts, and **dual-axis combo charts**, to showcase insights clearly.

## Data Overview

The data used for this project includes various movie metrics such as:
- **Budget**: The production cost of the movie.
- **Worldwide Gross**: The total worldwide revenue generated by the movie.
- **Profit**: The difference between worldwide gross and budget.
- **Profit Margin**: The percentage of profit relative to the budget.
- **Ratings**: Ratings from platforms like IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Letterboxd.

## Key Insights

1. **Budget vs. Worldwide Gross**:
   - A **moderate positive correlation** between budget and worldwide gross was found. Higher-budget movies tend to make more money, but there are outliers where lower-budget films did exceptionally well.

2. **Revenue Trends Over Time**:
   - The MCU has seen **consistent growth** in earnings over the years, reflecting its increasing global popularity.

3. **Rating Distribution**:
Ratings across different platforms showed that **audience ratings** and **criticsâ€™ scores** often diverge, showing the varied perspectives of viewers versus critics.

4. **Profitability and Profit Margin**:
While big-budget films tend to have high **absolute profits**, smaller-budget movies often perform better in terms of **profit margin**, which indicates a more efficient use of resources.

5. **Dual-Axis Combo Chart**:
I used a **dual-axis combo chart** to compare the **absolute profit** and **profit margin** of the top 5 most profitable movies. This visualization helped illustrate the relationship between profit and profitability in a clear and intuitive way.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (v3.x)
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization, including creating the dual-axis combo chart.
- **Seaborn**: For additional visualizations and styling.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For documenting and running the analysis.
